# Welcome to Project 1 (Week 1!)Review

For this project we were preparing ourselves to be able to work well with the Command Line Interface (CLI), Visual Studio Code (VSC) as a whole, and to gain experience on writing and executing non-web server Node.js javascript code.


## Displaying folders through the (CLI) Command Line Interface

### Main takeaway/Interest from this Project 1:
   - I was really intrigued and interested by the communication between the server and how it can show the current pin, also the fact that you can literally use the (CLI) to honestly acess whatever inside of a computer is really interesting to me as well.
